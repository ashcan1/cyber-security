// connection kali linux to internet //

It is not broken, it is a feature. Kali comes with networking disabled by default to prevent denouncing your own presence through an unconscionable DHCP request.

You will have to start your connection with the traditional Linux means, something like

 sudo ifconfig eth0 up
 sudo dhclient eth0
or some such thing, depending on how you see fit.
